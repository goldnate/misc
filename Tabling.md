### Engaging Strangers

It can be difficult and nerve-racking to engage strangers with your politics. There are two reasons for this. First, people may feel nervous about "bothering" passers-by. Second, people may not feel confident that others will value what we value.

#### How to not bother people

Look at their eyes. You can sense whether they are guarded, or lost in thought or conversation, or open to engagement.
